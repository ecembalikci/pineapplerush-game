# pineapplerush-game
a basic multiplayer 2d platform game which is developed with Photon Unity Networking 2. 

Before starting the game, you choose to be the host or client, then after setting your user name, simply push the "Spawn Character" button. The main idea here is to kill the other gamer by shooting pineapples. While the rock in the middle with angry face will make you lose health very badly, the character on top, which looks like a hawaiian puppet, will make you gain some health. Try out and see who will survive!
